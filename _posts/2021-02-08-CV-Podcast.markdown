At the end of last year, I had the pleasure to talk with Anthony Kelly about my experiences creating machine learning products at his Computer Vision in Production Podcast. 

The episode is [available in Spotify now](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3FtbVV4Q9NSKdISJ1DxBEd?si=389a6bc882304c3d). I hope that you enjoy it :)
