[In this online workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Computer-Vision-Group/events/274754583/), we will discuss deep learning methods of image segmentation:

- Semantic segmentation with [U-net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)

- Instance segmentation with [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870)

- Panoptic segmentation with [Panoptic Feature Pyramid Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02446.pdf)

We will use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) as compute environment the workshop won't require the installation of local software.
